      Enables major upgrades.
        - Allows downgrading.
          It's sometimes necessary to revert back to an older version because the currently deployed version is not behaving correctly. This 
          enables deploying an older version without having to manually uninstall the current version first.
        - Preserves modified configuration files.
          MSI will preserve an existing file if it is marked as a key component and has been modified since installation. The default install sequence for 
          major upgrades removes files before installing new ones. This makes it impossible to check if a file has been modified since it'll be removed before 
          the check.
          Scheduling RemoveExistingProducts after InstallExecute ensures that configuration files are not removed during the installation process.
          RemoveExistingProducts removes files when their reference count reaches 0. Since InstallExecute is scheduled earlier than RemoveExistingProducts, 
          a configuration file's reference count will increase to 2 before being reduced to 1 and so, won't be removed.
